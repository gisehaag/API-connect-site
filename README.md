## My Weather App

Looking for gain some experience working with API requests and asynchronous JavaScript, I found this idea and I love it 💚!

In fact, I'm pretty addicted to checking the weather every day, and I feel very curious about meteorology.

I got some inspiration in [this article](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/build-a-simple-weather-app-with-vanilla-javascript--cms-33893), especially with the API chosen.

I played with JavaScript for displays differents background colors related to time and weather conditions, the same with icons.

Now I feel more comfortable working with asynchronous JS, after fighting a little bit with it 🤓.
